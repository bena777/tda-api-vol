# tda-api-vol
Uses TDA API in order to scrape data with a main focus on implied volatility surfaces as well as option greeks.
2024 UPDATE: Due to TDA's recent merger with Schwab, the API endpoints used in this application are down. I am working currently to transition the library to utilize Schwab's API instead.
